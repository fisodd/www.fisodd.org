Fisodd?  What is this 'fisodd'?...

The pronounciation may be something like ``fizz-sod``,
but 'fisodd' comes from the observation that
"f is odd", or more clearly: *F is an odd number*.

   Specifically, '0xF' represents the value of 15 in
   `Hexadecimal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal>`_.

For many the idea that 'F' is a number just seems odd (as in strange),
but for those who spend too much time working with the lower level
interfaces in computing, 'F' is a perfectly valid number
representing the value 15, which is odd (not even).

The phrase "F is odd" dates back to this author's time back in college,
as a dual-major trying to explain
to fellow students and faculty in the English department
what it was like to be simultaneously working
on a Computer Science degree.

.. sidebar:: Choose Your Own Adventure Series

   `Ray Montgomery <http://www.cyoa.com/pages/r-a-montgomery-1936-2014>`_,
   well ahead of his time, believed that the non-linear storytelling
   of his `choose-your-own-adventure stories <https://www.cyoa.com/>`_
   would translate well to the new medium of home computers.

Back then (in the time before personal computers were common)
for my first job in "tech" I had lucked into a casual part-time position
with a local writer and publisher, Ray Montgomery,
who was transforming some of his children's adventure stories
into interactive computer games.
Ray had already done most of the hard part:
squeezing an entire book's worth of text plus some game play
to fit within the tight constraints of an
`Atari console <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600>`_.

   Figure: An example dump of hexidecimal data.

Like most every first job, I was assigned the left-over grunt work.
The main task was to review and verify all of the game's text messages,
in their final compressed and encoded form.
I would spend several hours at a time proof-reading
line after line of hexadecimal digits,
seemingly endless sequences that looked like
``6c6f 6f6b 7320 6d6f 7374 6c79 206c 696b 6520 6a75 6e6b``
(except owing to the pecularities of the compression method,
the encoding scheme used was even less directly translatable).

Needless to say, spending too much time looking at nothing
but hexadecimal dumps of data does corrupt one's thinking.
After days of checking hex codes and yet more hex,
life back in the real world occasionally would be difficult.
It is bad enough when roommates laugh
because you talk as if there are 'C' eggs in a dozen.
But things can get a bit tricky at the local store
when you forget that dollars are always decimal
and you act as if a dime is worth 16 cents.
Explaining how to go between the two counting systems
quickly became a necessary skill.

From this low-level start through to the current day,
I often find myself bridging between people and their
technological problems -- 
translating between the precise bit-denominated realms of processing
and the more rough-hewn daily realities of this world.

And so, even now, I am still working to explain how and why
*F is odd*.
