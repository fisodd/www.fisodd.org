Hugo and reStructured Text
##########################

Hugo supports reStructuredText as one of the
`additional formats
<https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#additional-formats-through-external-helpers>`__
for input markup.

OK.  So what?...

.. _pull-quote:

.. This is a comment, or what a comment looks like in reStructuredText.
   This comment is here to note that the line above is a link target
   for the link later in the text that references the pull quote below.

.. pull-quote::

   Markup syntax that is readable and simple,
   yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.

reStructuredText is a plaintext markup
developed by people who write documentation as their primary job.
As described in
`the project goals
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html#goals>`__,
the desire was "to design a markup syntax [...] that is readable and simple,
yet powerful enough for non-trivial use."
This is a markup that can comfortably handle a large range of tasks
which frustrate the simpler systems and yet it retains the direct utility
of a markup based on easy-to-read plain text.

Frankly, for many Hugo-based blogs, reStructuredText may be overkill.
But some of us crave a clean solution that can
:sup:`superscript` and :sub:`subscript` without calling out to LaTeX,
handle inline images (|inlineimage|),
understand the difference between a `pull-quote`_ and `epigraphs`_,
flush images to either the right or the left,
even support more formal figures when images need annotations,
also handle footnotes\ [#]_ and citations expertly,
as well as manage sidenotes to display related thoughts.
All in human-readable plain-text markup,
without new Hugo codewords, or additional helper projects.

.. sidebar:: reStructuredText

   "reStructuredText is an easy-to-read,
   what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system.
   It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings),
   for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents."
   From http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

This Restructuredtext Hugo theme works with the HTML generated by
the docutils package that is supported within Hugo's additional helpers.
The templates in this theme provide straightforward displays of articles,
and the CSS provided understands each of the features of the generated HTML.

Predictably, demonstrating too many features within a short webpage
leads to overly cluttered looking results.
Nevertheless, it is hoped this sample still offers an intriguing taste
of what can be done with reStructuredText in Hugo.
As a shortcut to providing more complete examples,
the other postings in the `rest section </rest/>`__
of this site are copies of documents straight from
`the reStructuredText reference materials
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__.
All of these reference materials work well in this Hugo theme
pretty much as is, no notable changes are required.

.. _epigraphs:

.. epigraph::

   Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler.

   Make it easy to read.

Implementation Details
**********************

Making Figures Responsive
=========================

The HTML generated by the Docutils that support reStructuredText
is generally constructed well enough to be adaptable to a wide
range of usages.
However, being specific in the markup can help
make the figures more responsive to mobile vistors
and the many varieties of browser display sizes.

Specifically, for the ``figure`` directives
it may help to specify a ``:figwidth:`` option as a percentage, e.g. 30%,
as this allows the figure to adapt its absolute size
to match the relative size of the column in the user's browser display.
Specifying a fixed pixel width for figures
can lead to problems as browsers adapt to different window sizes.

.. figure:: Metal_movable_type.jpg
   :figwidth: 33%
   :alt: Movable Type
   :align: right

   Repeat of the movable type picture,
   this time without including the ``:width: 100%`` option;
   note how the image may extend outside the column
   when the browser window is made smaller.

Furthermore, providing an additional ``:width: 100%`` option
to the figure definition provides the detail necessary
to ensure that the image within the figure will be scaled
to the best size to remain constrained within the figure's full area.
The figure here to the right is an example of what happens
if the the ``:width: 100%`` option is left out.
This image to the right is identical to
the image near the top right of this article,
and this figure definition is the same
except for lacking the ``:width:`` option;
the difference is
the image is no longer constrained to fit within the figure boundaries.

Optional Widths for Sidebars
============================

.. sidebar:: Narrow
   :class: narrow

   This is a narrow sidebar.
   Potentially useful if the content is skinny.

   === ====
   Num Word
   === ====
    0  Zero
    1  One
    2  Two
    3  Many
    4  Many
   ... ...
   999 Many
   ... ...
   === ====

The CSS used here includes a small tweak for sidebars:
an option for wide or narrow sidebars.

Add a ``:class: narrow`` or ``:class: wide`` option
to the sidebar definition and the matching CSS specification will be used,
so sidebars can be made to be
20% (narrow) or 40% (default) or 60% (wide)
of the width of the column.

Code Highlighting
=================

The Docutils parser is indepentent of the default Hugo markdown parser
and hence does not invoke Hugo's default
`syntax highlighting
<https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/>`__.
Full support for syntax highlighting may come
if/when there is a native Go implementation of reStructuredText.
Unfortunately, while there are different implementations of
reStructuredText in Go, none has yet reached sufficient maturity
to be included in Hugo and
`the ticket <https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/1436>`__
for this enhancement request
was closed in late 2017 for lack of activity.

.. code:: python

   def my_function():
       "just a test"
       print 8/2

The Docutils package that manages reStructuredText does support
syntax highlighting with `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`__.
If Pygments was successfully installed on the Hugo system,
the snippet of Python code above should have some syntax highlighting.

.. note:: It can be illustrative to see the original markup,
   to compare with the finished results.
   A copy of the raw markup that was used for this page is available
   `here </rest/hugo-and-restructuredtext.rst>`__.
